## Features and Requirements

The app loads data from an external API (https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon), users should be able to view a list of data and see more details by clicking on a given item.

## Technical Requirements

* The app must load data from an external API; for instance, the PokÃ©mon API.
* The app must display a list of items loaded from that API after the page is loaded.

demand, such as when clicking on a list item.
* The app must have CSS styling.
* The JavaScript code must be formatted according to ESLint rules.
* The JavaScript code may be formatted via Prettier.
* The JavaScript code may be manually formatted.
* The app must use at least one additional complex UI pattern, such as a modal, for details or
touch interactions.
* The app must not throw any errors when being used.
* The app should be deployed to a publicly accessible platform like GitHub Pages (you can
review how to do this in Intro to Frontend Development's Exercise 10: Code Quality, Testing, &
Web Hosting).
* The app must work in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Internet Explorer 11.
